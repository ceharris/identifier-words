But if the first entry tested is not a match, now the algorithm begins searching sequentially through the table. If the input really is in the table, it will often be \"nearby\" because that's the way the values are inserted into the table. But what if the input we seek is _not_ in the table?

A _Set_ data structure that can hold an arbitrary number of elements is often implemented as an array of linked lists. In this algorithm, the hash function is used to find the right \"bucket\" in the array for a given input. Each bucket points to the head of a linked list that holds all members of the set that produce the same hash value. If the hash function is reasonably uniform, and the hash table is large enough, the size of the list attached to each bucket in the array will be small and fairly consistent across the entire hash table. Therefore the time that it takes to determine whether a given element is a member of the set is _O(1)_ on average even when the input element we are testing is _not_ in the set."

        "\n",
        "As previously noted, when searching for substrings of a randomly generated identifier, we expect most searches to be unsuccessful. We know this from our analysis of the probabilties for generating a random string that matches a dictionary word of a given length. \n",
        "\n",
        "We now know that a typical implementation of a Set data structure (in Python) has a near Normal distribution of expected search times, with a narrow band of significant variation; i.e. the curve is tall and skinny. This tells us that successful searches will have consistent, predictable performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's produce data for unsuccessful dictionary searches. The basic idea is to generate random strings of characters of lengths from 3 to the maximum word size in a given dictionary, and to measure the elapsed time of testing for a match. Just as we did for successful searches, we'll test one hundred thousand randomly generated character strings against dictionaries with maximum word lengths of 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n",
        "\n",
        "If happen to generate word that does appear in the dictionary, we'll get an elapsed time similar to what we saw in the prior analysis, which could tend to skew our results. The probability of finding matches for words of lengths 3 or 4 is high enough that in 100,000 samples we'll have a few matches. We might be able to discern that in the Kernel Density Estimate when we plot the results."

        "With the largest outliers removed, we now we can see that the distribution is generally pretty tall and narrow much like it was for successful searches. Most of the area under these curves falls between about 5 microseconds and and 10 microseconds; i.e. most unsuccessful searches will have elapsed times in that range. We see a lot more variation within that range. \n",
        "\n",
        "As we discussed previously, a common approach to a Set implementation is an array of linked lists. The time complexity of finding the correct bucket in the array for a given input is always _O(1)_. If, as a function of the quality of the hash, and the number of elements in the set, most words in the set are in different buckets, we would expect unsuccessful searches to have elapsed times approximately the same as unsuccessful searches. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, if the hash function tends to produce collisions (in which one or more distinct words hash to the value) or if the table size is such that distinct hashes end up in the same bucket (hash modulo table size), then the time required for an unsuccessful search varies depending on the length of the linked list associated with the target array bucket and the search algorithm used for the linked list. Typically, if the items in the set are orderable, the list for each array bucket is ordered, and the time complexity of searching it is therefore _O(k/2)_ where _k_ is the size of the list. Again as a function of hash algorithm and table size, _k_ is generally much smaller than the number of elements in the set.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### So what does this analysis tell us about unsuccessful searches?\n",
        "\n",
        "We've learned that unsuccessful searches of a Set data structure in Python have near constant time performance over a range of different dictionary sizes, just as we saw for successful searches. The size of the dictionary has little to no impact. Unsuccessful searches take longer than successful searches, but by a relatively small multiple of the time required for a successful search."

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "The elapsed time for a search of a hash-based set of dictionary words (using Python) on current generation processors will typically be less than 10 µsec. If we consider all substrings of our eight character identifiers that are at least three characters in length, we will need to perform at most 21 such searches to determine that a randomly generated identifier does not contain a dictionary word. This would take approximately 210 µsec; considerably less than one millisecond. This is insignificant in the context in which such identifiers need to be generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The probability of finding matches for dictionary words of length 3 is about 1 in 32,000. Each eight-character identifier contains six substrings of length 3, any of which could be a match for a dictionary word. Therefore the probability of finding a three-letter dictionary word in a given randomly generated identifier is about 6 in 32,000 or about 1 in 5,300. In other words if we generate approximately 10,000 random identifiers, we would expect to reject a couple of them because they contain a word. \n",
        "\n",
        "When we reject an identifier, we must discard it and generate another. But since this won't happen often, it does not appreciably change the average time to generate an identifier that does not contain a dictionary word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The size of the dictionary has neglible impact on performance when considering words of up to eight characters in length. The size of the dictionary containing words of length 3 to 8 is approximately 1 MiB which is not significant in the context of the classes of machines that would be used for this purpose. However, given the vanishingly small probability of randomly generating a dictionary word that is 6, 7, or 8 characters in length, using a dictionary with a maximum word size of 5 would be sensible and would require one tenth of the memory required for a dictionary with a maximum word size of 8 characters. For another approximately 150 KiB we could include six letter words (for which our probability of generating is about 1 in a billion)."

        "#### But Aren't We Using Java?\n",
        "\n",
        "Good point. If you look at the source code for the implementation of the `HashSet` type in Java, you'll find that a `HashSet` is a subtype of `HashMap` in which the values are irrelevant (only the keys matter). And you'll discover that a Java `HashMap` is implemented as a hash table in which each bucket is a linked list. Each element in the list consists of a key and a reference to the corresponding value (since it's a map). Sound familiar?\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation in Python is very similar. The hash functions used for strings are also quite similar between the two languages. Bottom line, our results with a Java implementation of these ideas should be very similar although likely faster in absolute terms, simply because the statically-typed Java runtime is faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, nothing tells the story better than real data. I made an equivalent measurement test for a Java implementation of a dictionary search and produced elapsed time results for both successful and random (mostly unsuccessful) searches. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's quickly look at the random search results. The results are in CSV datafiles with columns that contain the results for maximum word lengths of 5 through 8 and elapsed times in nanoseconds (because that's what Java's `System.nanoTime` produces). We can load the CSV data using the `read_csv` function of Pandas and then scale the resulting data frame to microseconds."

        "\n",
        "Please pardon the gratiutous _Wheel of Fortune_ reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another suggested approach to solving the problem of recognizable words in our identifiers is to eliminate all of the vowels from the symbol set used to generate identifiers. As mentioned previously, the symbol set used by our identifiers is a Base-32 symbol set which contains letters A-Z and digits 2-7. What if, when selecting random characters to use for an identifier, we excluded all of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U)? The vowels are still in the Base-32 symbol set, so an identifier using them would still be valid, but generated identifiers would never contain them (almost).\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifiers in Summit start with a letter that designates a _namespace_; proposal identifiers start with `P`, agreement identifiers start with `A`, etc. The next six characters are randomly selected from the Base-32 alphabet. The eighth and final character is generated using an adaptation of the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) computed using all of the first seven characters in the identifier. The adaptation uses base-32 instead of base-10, so the resulting check digit is a base-32 symbol from the same symbol set. This approach of generating identifiers provides $32^6 = 1,073,741,824$ possible identifiers in each namespace because there are 6 characters in the identifier that can use any of 32 possible symbol choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we eliminate all five vowels as possible choices for each identifier, then the number of possible identifiers is reduced to $27^6 = 387,420,489$. That's still pretty big, right? It is but by eliminating about 63% of the symbol space, we've also increased the likelihood of _collisions_. A collision occurs when we generate an random identifier and then subsequently determine that it is already in use. \n",
        "\n",
        "Is the greater potential for collisions a problem? _Maybe_. Probably not right now, but imagine what happens after we've used about a hundred thousand identifiers in a given space. Then our probability for a collision will be about 1 in 3,000 instead of about 1 in \n",
        "10,000 (which it would be if were using all of the vowels too). That might be a little too tight for comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eliminating the vowels is certainly not an idea that we should dismiss out of hand, but if the cost of implementing our dictionary search is small, it has a much less significant impact on the total size of a given identifier namespace. \n",
        "\n",
        "You might be wondering why I said _almost_; that we would _almost_ eliminate vowels in identifiers. The Luhn check \"digit\" at the end of the identifier could (and more often than not would) be a vowel. That probably doesn't create new opportunities for offensive words, unless you already have a problem with _ho_ or _fu_. 😉\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're looking for a fun challenge, you might ponder ways to estimate how much of the namespace is lost by eliminating identifiers that contain recognizable words. It's far smaller than what is lost by eliminating vowels, but how much smaller?\n",

        "#### Look-alike Digits\n",
        "When the Division of Motor Vehicles runs your desired vanity license plate string through their \"objectionable plates\" algorithm, they also exclude clever uses of digits as letters. Say you're a big [James Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond) fan and you'd like to immortalize your fascination with actress [Honor Blackman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_Blackman) and her role as [Pussy Galore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Galore) in the movie _Goldfinger_. If you think you're getting `PU55Y` on your license plate, you're probably going to be disappointed.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can easily handle look-alike digits with the previously described search for identifier substrings using a dictionary. When we produce an identifier string, instead of searching for substrings of the actual identifier, we instead create a variant in which we've substituted all of the look-alike digits for the equivalent letter. We do our substring searches using this variant instead of the original identifier.\n",
